/*
* The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question:
*  "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities,
*  what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?"
*  It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in theoretical computer science and operations research.

The travelling purchaser problem and the vehicle routing problem are both generalizations of TSP.
